We have an ecosystem here that needs to be preserved. 
It is very important to differentiate between the good and bad flowers. For the good ones
need to be watered to give more flowers and the bad ones need to be cut. Like this. Do
what I do. Water the pink plants, But cut those with the red round seeds
