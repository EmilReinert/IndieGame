Oh that person I know. Why do you posses this photo?
-Oh! Really! Well , I guess the person you re looking for is me!
-I never returned. You see the lions ate my leg and it was very hard for me to
keep moving. So I made this tree my home. 
-You can stay with me. But there is always a way out! You seem brave enough to take that path and see what's ahead of you.
