Watch your steps! 
Stay close to me!
This is a place where many scientists lost their life.
It is highly toxic. In the beginning they used the place to swim with the fireflies.
But soon we realised that the people entering the lakes were facing death from severe intoxication, 
and avoided them since with any cost.

I heard you're looking for your grandmother. I don't know if I can help you.
I'm not a people's person.
I have spent the last 50 years in my small lab researching.


See the crystals? They are beautiful right?
Don't touch them! Unless I say so. 
They are highly toxic. They need very careful treatment now that the laboratory work station is down.

At first all the area was covered in them. But we used them up.
This place? It's the consistency of the organic matter in addition to the toxic water and the high humidity levels that allowsfor the crystals to keep growing.


I kept researching on them after the accident. No, not all experiments were successful! But I inserted
algae to the the crystals and managed to detoxify them!
Those creatures? Yes toxic too. But they won't hurt you!Let me show you.
