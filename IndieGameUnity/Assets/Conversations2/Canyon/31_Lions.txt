Shhh! I hear something! The lions! This is the area where the lions live.
Actually this is the place I last saw your grandmother. She was caught by one of them.
From now on you are alone. I don't know what exists after this but please hide whenever you see a lion.
Go to the bush next to water and throw this steak to the lions!
