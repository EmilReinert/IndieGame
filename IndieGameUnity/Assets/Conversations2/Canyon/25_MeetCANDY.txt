Hi!!!!  

Oh my! Come here! 
Where are you from? What are you doing here? 
Oh you look tired! You made it throught the toxic lakes right! 
Well done! Come wash your eyes with some water. Drink some too!
Finally a hand! Those guys up there are too old to move their legs down here! 
I am sending them their daily goods. 
Let me show you.
