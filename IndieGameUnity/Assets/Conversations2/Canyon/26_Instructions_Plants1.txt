We have an ecosystem here that needs to be preserved. I take care of all these plants and trees. 
For example, It is very important to differentiate between the good and bad flowers. The good ones need to be watered and the bad ones need to be cut. Try it!
The pink flowers seem thirsty but the orange ones are over hydrated!
